# First-Order Logic
The implementation of the first-order logic based on the [Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01719) project.


This repository contains the implementation of the basic objects and operations first-order logic.
The code is mainly from the [Differentiable Inductive Logic Programming repository](https://github.com/hkrsnd/dilp-st).
